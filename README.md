# 2048
This is was originally a project for my _Intro to Computer Science_ class in college. 
It is based off the popular game [2048](https://play2048.co/), with the implementation of a GUI and Expectimax AI system.

# Features
- 2048 game clone  
- tkinter UI
- Expectimax AI using heuristics for
monotonicity, empty tiles, smoothness and weighted evaluation

# Expectimax
The Expectimax algorithm used in this project takes into consideration the following heuristics: monotonicity, weighted table evaluation, log 2 fold change (smoothness), concentration and empty tile count.
